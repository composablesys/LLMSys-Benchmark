class PN_data(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    """
    A dataset class for parallel data consisting of noisy speech and the corresponding clean speech.
    This is used in supervised learning or for the validation/test set for PULSE and MixIT.

    Args:
        partition: The data partition. The returns differ depending on whether partition == 'train'.
        frame_len: The frame length for the short-time Fourier transform.
        wav_len: The waveform length of each audio clip.
        fname: The path to the configuration file.
        clean_path: The directory path of the clean speech dataset. (not used)
        noise_path: The directory path of the noise dataset. (not used)

    Returns:
        feat: The power-law compressed magnitude spectrogram of mixture_stft. (NB: This is unnecessary
            as it can be computed from mixture_stft and is to be removed in future updates.)
        mask (only in the case "partition == 'train'"): This is a dummy variable and not used. (This
            is used just to make sure that there are four outputs for the sake of consistency with
            other dataset classes.)
        mixture_stft: Noisy speech in the short-time Fourier transform domain.
        clean_stft (only in the case "partition == 'train'"): Clean speech in the short-time Fourier
            transform domain.
        mixture_wav (only in the case "partition != 'train'"): Noisy speech in the time domain.
        clean_wav (only in the case "partition != 'train'"): Clean speech in the time domain.

class PU_train_data(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    """
    A dataset class for the training set for PULSE, where each example is either noisy speech or
    noise. The examples with even indices are noisy speech examples, which are considered to be
    unlabelled data. The examples with odd indices are noise examples, which are considered to be
    positive examples.

        frame_len: The frame length for the short-time Fourier transform.

        mask: A binary mask indicating whether each time-frequency component is a positive example (1)

            odd indices, this is a matrix of all ones.
