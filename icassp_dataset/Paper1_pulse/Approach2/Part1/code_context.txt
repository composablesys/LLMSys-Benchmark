    The weighted loss for learning from positive and unlabelled data (PU learning). 
    
    Args:
        y: A mask indicating whether each time-frequency component is positive (1) or unlabelled (0).
        yhat: The output of the convolutional neural network before the non-linear activation function.
        mix_stft: The noisy speech in the short-time Fourier transform domain.
        prior: The class prior for the positive class.
        p: The exponent for the weight. p = 1.0 corresponds to weighting by the magnitude spectrogram of the 
            input noisy speech. p = 0.0 corresponds to no weighting.
        
    Returns:
        The weighted loss.
