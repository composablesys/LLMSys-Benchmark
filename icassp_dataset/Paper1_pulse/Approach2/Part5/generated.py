    Train a speech enhancement model. The model checkpoint with the maximum validation SI-SNRi is stored

        model: The speech enhancement model to be trained.
        epochs: The number of epochs.
        train_loader: The data loader for the training set.
        val_loader: The data loader for the validation set.
        prior: The class prior for the positive class.
        frame_len: The frame length for the short-time Fourier transform.
        p: The exponent in the weight for the weighted sigmoid loss, which equals 1.0 for weighting
            by the magnitude spectrogram and 0.0 for no weighting.
        
    Returns:
        max_si_sdri: The maximum validation SI-SNRi.
